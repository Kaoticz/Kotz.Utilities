# Kotz.Extensions

Defines the following extension methods:

- **Array Extensions**
    - Several wrappers for `System.Array` static methods.
- **DateTimeOffset Extensions**
    - StartOfDay: Gets the beginning of the day for the current DateTimeOffset object.
- **Enum Extensions**
    - HasOneFlag: Checks if the current enum has at least one of the provided bit flags.
    - ToFlags: Flattens a collection of enums to a single enum value that contains all bit flags from the enums in the collection. It's the opposite of `ToValues()`.
    - ToStrings: Creates a collection of human-readable strings of the current enum.
    - ToValues: Segregates bit flags into a collection of enum values of their own. It's the opposite of `ToFlags()`.
    - ToggleFlag: Returns an enum with the provided bit flag set if it's not currently set, and vice-versa.
- **IEnumerable\<T> Extensions**
    - AtLeast: Checks if the current collection contains at least the specified amount of elements and exits early if it does.
    - ContainsOne: Checks if the current collection contains at least one element of a given collection.
    - ContainsSubcollection: Checks if the current collection contains all elements of a given collection.
    - NestedFill: Adds a sample object to the inner collections of a collection of collections until they all have the same length.
    - RandomElement: Gets a random element from the current collection.
    - ToConcurrentDictionary: Converts the current collection to a `ConcurrentDictionary<T, U>`.
    - Unique: Gets the symetric difference between all elements in the current and specified collections.
    - When: Fluent version of an `if` statement.
    - WhenAllAsync: Awaits all tasks in the current `IEnumerable<Task>` and returns when all of them have completed.
    - WhenAnyAsync: Awaits all tasks in the current `IEnumerable<Task>` and returns when any of them have completed.
    - ChunkBy: Splits a collection into a collection of collections based on the provided key selector.
- **IReadOnlyList\<T> Extensions**
    - IndexOf: Get the index of the first element that matches a predicate.
    - LastIndexOf: Get the index of the last element that matches a predicate.
    - TryGetValue: safely get an element from the collection, or `default(T)` if it fails.
- **List Extensions**
    - AsSpan: Gets the current list as a `Span<T>` object.
    - AsReadOnlySpan: Gets the current list as a `ReadOnlySpan<T>` object.
- **Object Extensions**
    - EqualsAny: Checks whether the current object equals any of the specified objects.
- **ReadOnlySpan Extensions**
    - AsEnumerable: Enumerates the current span.
- **Span Extensions**
    - AsEnumerable: Enumerates the current span.
    - Rotate: Rotates a span from a starting position by the specified amount of indices.
- **String Extensions**
    - Contains: Checks if the current string occurs within at least one of the entries in the provided collection.
    - EndsWith: Checks whether the end of the current string matches any string stored in the provided collection.
    - Equals: Checks whether the current string is equal to any of the provided strings.
    - EqualsOrStartsWith: Checks if the current string is <u>equal</u> or <u>starts with **the first character**</u> of another provided string.
    - FirstOccurrenceOf: Returns the "Nth" index of the provided character.
    - GetDigits: Returns a string with all digits present in this string.
    - HasFirstWordOf: Checks if the current string and the provided string contain the same first word.
    - LastOccurrenceOf: Returns the last "Nth" index of the provided character.
    - MaxElementLength: Get the length of the longest string of the current collection.
    - MaxLength: Truncates the string to the maximum specified length.
    - Occurrences: Gets the amount of occurences of a given character in the current string.
    - StartsWith: Checks whether the beginning of the current string matches any string stored in the provided collection.
    - ToSnakeCase: Converts the current string to the *snake_case* format.
- **StringBuilder Extensions**
    - ReplaceAll: Replaces all instances of a substring with another substring, even if the new substring is a substring of the old substring.
    - ToStringAndClear: Returns the `string` value of the current builder and clears the builder.
